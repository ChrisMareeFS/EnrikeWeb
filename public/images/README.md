# Image Assets

Place your images in this directory with the following filenames:

## Required Images

1. **hero-bg.jpg** - Main hero background image
   - Dimensions: 1920x1080px or larger
   - Use one of the professional outdoor photos of Enrike
   - This will be the first thing visitors see

2. **enrike-portrait.jpg** - Portrait for About section
   - Dimensions: 600x800px (3:4 aspect ratio)
   - Professional portrait of Enrike
   - Should convey approachability and expertise

3. **contact-bg.jpg** - Contact section background
   - Dimensions: 1920x1080px or larger
   - Can be another field/outdoor shot
   - Will have a dark overlay, so contrast is important

4. **speaking-bg.jpg** - Speaking page background
   - Dimensions: 1920x1080px or larger
   - Enrike speaking or in a professional setting

## Image Optimization

All images should be:
- High quality (at least 1920px wide for backgrounds)
- Optimized for web (compressed but not overly so)
- In JPG format for photographs

Next.js will automatically optimize these images for different screen sizes.

## Using Your Attached Photos

Based on the photos you've attached, I recommend:
- Use the portrait photos for `hero-bg.jpg` and `enrike-portrait.jpg`
- Use the wider landscape shots for backgrounds
- Choose images with good natural lighting and the green field aesthetic

## Temporary Placeholders

Until you add your images, the site will show placeholder images. The layout and glassmorphism effects are designed to work beautifully with your actual photos.
